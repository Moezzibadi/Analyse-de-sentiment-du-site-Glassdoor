# Analyse-de-sentiment-du-site-Glassdoor
 
 The aim of this project is natural language processing and sentiment analysis applied to scraped reviews from employees. 

The notebook has three main parts : 

1) Glassdoor reviews scraping using Selenium

2) Naive Bayes classification for positive and negative reviews recognition

3) Latent Dirichlet Allocation [[1]](#1) for topic modeling (Not a suitable method for this application as mentioned in presentation - as an alternative one should use : *Biterm Topic Model* [[2]](#2)).

- To be able to run the scraping part, a *secret.json* file containing the log-in identification is needed.

- For extra information, you can find the Rmarkdown presentaion (in french) here : https://moezzibadi.github.io/Analyse-de-sentiment-du-site-Glassdoor/Proj_gl.html
